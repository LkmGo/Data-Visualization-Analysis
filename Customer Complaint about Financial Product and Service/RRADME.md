I would use the data from the following link which is about the consumers’ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. The dataset has the complaints records information about time, type, company, location, whether get timely response and so on.
Through these information, we could improve the financial market by adding their voice. My basic ideas and objectives for analyzing this dataset is shown below.

Dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database

Objectives:
1.	Which type of products get most complaints
2.	Where are the consumers reflecting most complaints. 
3.	Whether the consumers get effective help.
4.	Do the complaints decrease there years
5.	……

I would try to use the map to describe the information of location, and use the bar chart and pie chart to show the statistics, and would also use the text analysis to reflect the details of the complaints from consumers.
